### Source code project
This source code Maven project generated by Transformation Advisor enables you to make changes to your application before migrating it to Liberty. The analysis document and report available in Transformation Advisor describe the changes necessary for a successful migration. If you are using Eclipse, the [IBM WebSphere Migration Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mw-1701-was-migration/index.html) makes source code updates easier. The toolkit is available in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/).
 
 ### How the bundle helps with modernization
 
  - Provides files that are necessary for containerization, accelerating the deployment to Liberty.
  
  - Helps you to be compliant with your company standards and use the architecture, tools, and pipelines defined for your team by enabling your builds for Accelerator for Teams.
- Sets up an Application project for local build, test and eventual deployment using the pipeline that is associated with your Accelerator for Teams collection.
